Project Overview
1.	Web Scraping with Selenium:
o	Automate the process of collecting data from the Redbus website.
o	Extract details such as Bus routes Link, Bus route Name, Bus name, Bus Type(Sleeper/Seater), Departing Time, Duration, Reaching Time, Star-rating, Price, Seat availability..
2.	Data Storage with SQL:
o	Store the scraped data in a SQL database.
o	Perform CRUD operations to manage the data efficiently.
3.	Data Analysis:
o	Analyze the collected data to gain insights into bus services, pricing trends, and availability patterns.
o	Use Python libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
4.	Interactive Application with Streamlit:
o	Develop a user-friendly interface to dynamically filter and display the data.
o	Enable users to search for buses based on specific criteria such as route, date, and price range.
o	Visualize the data using Streamlit's built-in charting capabilities.
5.	Skills Development:
o	Gain hands-on experience in web scraping with Selenium.
o	Learn to work with SQL databases for data storage and retrieval.
o	Develop skills in data analysis and visualization using Python.
o	Create interactive web applications using Streamlit.
This project will equip you with practical experience in web scraping, data analysis, and interactive application development, providing a comprehensive skill set for tackling similar challenges in the transportation domain or other industries.
